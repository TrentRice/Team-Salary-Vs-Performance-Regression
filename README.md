# Regression using Python Analyze if Higher Team Salaries lead to Higher Winning Percentages

## The goal of this repository was to use python regression analysis to see the effect that salaries in the EPL, NFL, NBA, and NHL have on a teams winning percentage. The different leagues were tested due to the variety in salary cap structures with EPL and MLB having little to no restirctions and the NBA and NFL having stricter cap rules. Last seasons winning percentages were also taken into account along with fixed effects based on team by team comparisons.
